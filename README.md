# XAI-in-Bioinformatics
A list of Github repositories to centralize methods and applications of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in bioinformatics

## Introduction 
The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning
(ML) tools across various domains has showcased their remarkable capabilities
and performance. Black-box AI models raise concerns about decision
transparency and user confidence. Therefore, explainable AI (XAI) and explainability
techniques have rapidly emerged in recent years. This repository
provides some XAI frameworks and their applications in bioinformatics,
with a particular focus on omics and imaging.  

## Methods
**[LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)**  
**[SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)](https://github.com/shap/shap)**  
**[Gradient-based methods](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations)**  
**[Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam)**  
**[LRP (Layer-wise relevance propagation)](https://github.com/sebastian-lapuschkin/lrp_toolbox)**  
**[IG (Integrated Gradients)](https://github.com/ankurtaly/Integrated-Gradients)**
